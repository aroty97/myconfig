Project name : myConfig

The goal of this project is to create a personal, portable configuration able to run on any possible linux-kernel based TERMINAL.
Whatever the virtual terminal used, my configuration should apply.
To do so, I will only use terminal-based programs : my home is the terminal, and I will be able to carry my home anywhere I want.

There is a git repository inside the project, and a github where I occasionnaly push my changes.

Configurations and implemented programs : 
colorThemes for the VT, which are then transmitted to all the programs running inside the VT.
